# Basic instructions
The two most important parameters to correctly setup your VDBs in Unreal are **Local step size** and **Density** 
(aka ensity multiplier). Once you get good results these two parameters, use the other parameters to tweak your 
rendering.

Depending on your volume, **Local step size** usually have values from 0.005 to 10. Smaller raymarching steps values 
mean better quality but slower performances. For better performance keep this value as high as possible. 
For improved rendering quality decrease value.

Every Digital Content Creator tool (eg. Houdini, Embergen, Blender etc.) have different volume options and 
different export settings. **This is why importing different VDBs from different software sometimes require very
different plugin display options**.

Depending on your volume and according to my tests, **Density** usually have values ranging from 1 to 1000.

I’ve taken the arguable decision to only use **local** distances/sizes, i.e. **rendering will be independent of your volume scaling**.

If your are struggling with your VDB rendering, reset your volume scaling to (1, 1, 1) then check the local size of 
your volume. It could be 1000 units (i.e 10m) or maybe only 10 units (i.e 10cm). If you are targetting *performance 
vs quality*, you should probably aim for 50 to 200 raymarching steps. If you are aiming for 
*quality over performance*, you could have 100 to 1000 raymarching steps. It really depends on your needs and the VDB itself.

To get a rough idea on the number of steps, use this equation:  
`nb raymarch steps = local volume size / local step size` 

# FAQ
* Can my VDBs receive shadows ? Can my VDBs cast shadows on the environment ?

Sadly no. Plugins are not allowed to read or write shadows. I know this is a big limitation and I’ve asked Epic 
many times to open the renderer more but it is a long term project on their side with no ETA

* My blackbody explosions do not light the environment (realtime and pathtrace). Can you do something about it ?

Sadly for the same reasons above I do not have access to Lumen or other related lighting information from a plugin 
so blackbody VDBs do not influence the environment

* Why is my point light (or any other lights) not affecting the VDBs ?

See two points above. Only the first directional light and the skylight are supported for now.

* My VDB is shallow or very pixelated

First make sure the **Local step size** and the **Density** parameters are correctly setup (see 
[Basic Instructions](#basic-instructions)). You can also increase samples count (but I don’t 
recommend it for performance reasons, let Unreal's TAA care of it).

* My VDBs are really slow

Although NanoVDB finally brings some good GPU performance and some decent realtime results as demonstrated by 
this plugin, let’s not forget that anything volumetric is still extremely expensive and computationally intense. 
We obviously can’t expect the same results as offline renders. 

That being said, most people are not aware how performant current graphics cards are and that it is now a reality to 
have real volumetrics in a game engine. Reasonably large volumes render really well and fast with this plugin, 
depending on your VDB parameters. Very large volumes like the ones we usually see in the VFX industry are probably 
too big and expensive to render properly in real-time or interactive time.


* My volumes are too noisy. What can I do ?

Having realtime performance comes with a few sacrifices and approximations. Rendering with noise gives better 
results but requires a good denoiser. Unreal temporal anti-aliasing works well but VDBs do not (cannot) write motion 
vectors making TAA irrelevant with VDBs sequences or camera motion. There are options to turn off noise completely 
but it will introduce other artefacts.

* Can you do the same in Unity ?

No. I'm working on this plugin on my spare time only and don't have time (and motivation) to do this in Unity.

* I saw your cloud demo with JangaFX and/or your clouds in your example level. How can I add more clouds ? 
1. Open Blueprint and bump the maximum number of clouds to N (in the default values). Save and apply. 
2. Open the reference Material then copy paste the cloud box nodes N times and make sure to connect results.  
3. Add clouds in the Actor blueprint *Details panel*.

* What is the difference between VdbMaterial and VdbPrincipled ?

Unless you want to use the pathtracer, you should always use VdbMaterial Actors. Both actors have feature parity 
but VdbMaterial use Unreal materials, allowing custom user controlled rendering, better flexibility and other features.

For now only VdbPrincipled are pathtracer compatible but that will probably change very soon.

* What are the translucency issues with VDB and are there ways to overcome them?

Current translucency sorting issues:
1) VDB can be seen through volume material ([#39](https://github.com/eidosmontreal/unreal-vdb/issues/39) - can be solved my using Unreal default Volumetric Clouds and rendering VDB to volume texture by VdbToVolumeTextureActor ([#48](https://github.com/eidosmontreal/unreal-vdb/issues/48)), see BP_VdbToVolumetricClouds from plugin example level for a reference);
2) translucent material can be seen through VDB ([#39](https://github.com/eidosmontreal/unreal-vdb/issues/39) - problems with groom and translucent stays if you use Volumetric Clouds);
3) groom can be seen through VDB ([#32](https://github.com/eidosmontreal/unreal-vdb/issues/32) - can be partially solved by changing the code and recompiling the plugin).

# Pro tips

* You can introduce displacement on your volume to increase details and/or introduce some artificial motion on a 
static vdb. See example in Gallery scene.

* When introducing displacement your volume might over-extend its boundaries. Use *volume padding* to augment the 
volume size.

* The rendering model is greatly inspired by 
[Blender](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/shader_nodes/shader/volume_principled.html)
and [Arnold](https://docs.arnoldrenderer.com/display/A5AFMUG/Standard+Volume). If you want more information
on all rendering and volume parameters, check their documentations.

* When using Movie Render Queue (MRQ), use lighter VDBs parameters for faster rendering in the viewport and use 
console variables to improve offline rendering quality during MRQ renders. (coming soon)
